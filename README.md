#  Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Encrypted Messaging System

## Project Overview
This project is a **next-generation secure communication platform** that combines **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) authentication** with **end-to-end encrypted messaging**.

Unlike traditional login systems that rely on passwords stored on servers, our system ensures **no password ever leaves the user‚Äôs device**. Instead, authentication is achieved using **ZKP modular exponentiation**, providing **mathematical guarantees of identity** without revealing the secret itself.

Once authenticated, users can exchange messages encrypted with **AES-GCM**, ensuring **confidentiality, integrity, and forward secrecy**.

##  Why This Project Matters
-  **Privacy First** ‚Äì Users keep complete control of their secret keys (stored securely in **IndexedDB**, never transmitted).
-  **Zero-Knowledge Authentication** ‚Äì Prevents password leaks, phishing, and credential theft.
-  **End-to-End Encryption** ‚Äì Protects conversations even if the server is compromised.
-  **Scalable & Lightweight** ‚Äì Built with standard web technologies and a Python backend.
-  **Educational Impact** ‚Äì Demonstrates real-world cryptography and secure communication for academic and enterprise use cases.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- IndexedDB for secure key storage
- Web Crypto API & CryptoJS

**Backend**
- Python Flask
- SQLAlchemy (for user/session management)

**Security**
- AES-GCM for encryption/decryption
- Zero-Knowledge Proof (modular exponentiation) for login/authentication

---

## Features
-  **Zero-Knowledge Login** ‚Äì Users prove identity without sharing secrets.
-  **Secure Registration** ‚Äì Encrypted key generation and safe storage.
-  **Encrypted Messaging** ‚Äì Messages secured with AES-GCM.
-  **IndexedDB Key Storage** ‚Äì Protects private keys against local attacks.
-  **Flask API Backend** ‚Äì Secure communication channel between users.
